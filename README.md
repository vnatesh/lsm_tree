# lsm_tree

This project is an exploration of the write-optimized log-structured merge tree. The bloom filter optimizations from Monkey [1] and merging optimizations from Dostoevsky [2] are both implemented. Several other optimizations such as parallel k-way merging and efficient hashing for bloom filters are also implemented.
